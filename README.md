This Git repository encompasses two projects. A simple text to speech application, and a speech to text application which was sourced, cleaned, optimized and modified to test for the developer's own requirements.

The Text to Speech application features functionality such as, dark or light themes, a custom keyboard with various keyboard layouts, numerous languages, and user customisable speaking rate and pitch.
